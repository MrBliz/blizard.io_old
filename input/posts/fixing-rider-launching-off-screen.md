Sometimes on Windows, [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) will launch off screen. Alt Tabbing will not bring it back into view. It seems this a long standing bug with JetBrains products, but no resolution forthcoming.

Here's how to fix it.

1. Alt-Tab the right window to the foreground
1. Alt-Space to bring up the system menu for the active window (you won't be able to see this)
1. Down arrow once to select 'Move' (again, it's out of view)
1. Enter to select the menu item
1. Down arrow to start the window move
1. Mouse movement then will 'spring' the window into view.
